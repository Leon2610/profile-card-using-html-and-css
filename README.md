### Useful resources

- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - This helped me to reset the default CSS styles in a much easier way.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - It is definitely a much easier and faster way to write CSS code.
- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - It helped me a lot to understand the properties of Flexbox.
